## 📌 About the Project
 
**Ahaar Bonton (আহার বণ্টন)** is a web-based surplus food redistribution platform built specifically for the context of Bangladesh. Every day, significant amounts of food go to waste at restaurants, weddings, corporate events, and households, while many people struggle to meet their daily nutritional needs.
This platform provides a structured, community-driven solution to that contradiction. Donors can post surplus food listings, NGOs can claim and coordinate pickups, and volunteers can register to assist with deliveries – all through a single, unified platform designed to work within Bangladesh's existing social and organizational fabric.
 
> *"Ahaar" (আহার) means food, and "Bonton" (বণ্টন) means distribution – together, a name that speaks for itself.*

## ⚙️ How AhaarBonton Works

AhaarBonton follows a simple, transparent, and verified flow from food surplus to final delivery.

<br>

### 👤 Step 1  –  Donor Posts Food

A donor (restaurant, household, or event organizer) logs in and creates a food post with:
- Food title, description, and quantity
- Category (Cooked / Raw / Packaged / Bakery)
- Pickup location (auto-filled via GPS)
- Expiry date and time
- Optional food image

The post immediately becomes visible to all registered NGOs on their dashboard.

### 🏢 Step 2  –  NGO Requests Food

NGOs browse available food sorted by **expiry priority** (soonest expiring first).  
They can filter by category and see a live expiry countdown on each card.

When an NGO finds suitable food, they send a **collection request** with an optional message to the donor.

### ✅ Step 3  –  Donor Approves the Request

The donor reviews incoming requests and approves or rejects them.

On **approval**, the system automatically :
- Marks the food post as **Claimed**
- Creates a **Delivery record**
- Generates **two unique 6-digit OTPs**:
  - `Pickup OTP` → visible to the Donor (given to Volunteer at pickup)
  - `Delivery OTP` → sent to the NGO via email (given to Volunteer at delivery)

### 🚚 Step 4  –  Volunteer Accepts the Delivery

Volunteers browse open delivery jobs and accept one.

Each job shows :
- Pickup location (Donor's address)
- Drop-off location (NGO name)
- Food quantity and expiry time

### 🔐 Step 5  –  Pickup Confirmed (OTP 1)

The volunteer visits the donor and collects the food.  
The **Donor shares the Pickup OTP** with the volunteer.

The volunteer enters the Pickup OTP in their dashboard:
- ✅ Correct OTP → Pickup confirmed, status updates to **Picked Up**
- ❌ Wrong OTP → Error shown, volunteer must try again

At this point, the NGO receives an email notification:  
*"Food is on the way! Your Delivery OTP : XXXXXX"*

### 🏁 Step 6  –  Delivery Confirmed (OTP 2)

The volunteer arrives at the NGO and hands over the food.  
The **NGO shares the Delivery OTP** with the volunteer.

The volunteer enters the Delivery OTP in their dashboard :
- ✅ Correct OTP → Delivery confirmed, status updates to **Delivered**
- ❌ Wrong OTP → Error shown

### 🎉 Step 7  –  Completion & Impact

Once delivery is confirmed, the system automatically updates :

| What | Result |
|---|---|
| Food Post Status | `Delivered` |
| Food Request Status | `Completed` |
| Donor & Volunteer Trust Score | `+5 Points` |
| Transparency Dashboard | Updated With New Delivery |
| Donor Notification | Email Confirmation Sent |
