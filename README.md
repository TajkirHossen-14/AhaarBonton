### A Surplus Food Redistribution Platform
 
*Connecting Donors, NGOs, and Volunteers to Reduce Food Waste*
</div>

---
 
## 📖 About the Project
 
**Ahaar Bonton (আহার বণ্টন)** is a web-based platform built to bridge the gap between surplus food and those in need. Every day, enormous amounts of edible food go to waste at restaurants, events, and households — while many people go hungry. This platform provides a structured, community-driven solution to that problem.
 
Donors can post surplus food listings, NGOs can claim and coordinate pickups, and volunteers can register to assist with deliveries — all through a single, unified platform.
 
> *"Ahaar" (আহার) means food, and "Bonton" (বণ্টন) means distribution — together, a name that speaks for itself.*
